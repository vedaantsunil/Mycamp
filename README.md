# Mycamp

Mycamp is a simple but aesthetically pleasing campgrounds web app.

The user can register on the website which is secured highly using concepts of network security including salt&pepper method to ensure confidentiality.
Once logged in, the user can see campgrounds posted by people around the world, located on a beautiful map incorporated in the website.

Further, the user can not only add new campgrounds but also comment and give valuable feedback and other information like the price for a night and upload photos

The details and information about all the campgrounds and the users will be uploaded to MongoDB's cloud services (Atlas) and images would be uploaded to Cloudinary for better access.

Also to note, the project is highly scalable and versatile, there could be new features in the future and the concept could be expanded to various topics like schools, unis, stadiums, shopping malls etc.
